We shouldn't bail out the airlines. They have been running their businesses like a family who lives from paycheck to paycheck. If being grounded for a week causes them to teeter on the verge of bankruptcy, then they don't how to run their business. They should have had some cash reserves in case of an emergency. I always keep a four months supply of cash on hand in case I'm laid off from my job. There are too many airlines anyway. Let a few go out of business and let the strong survive. 

It's the government's job to protect the American public. It's the media's job to monitor the government and to report to the public when the government is not doing their job. Did the media's preoccupation with fluff prevent it from alerting the public to the terrorist threat and the government's failure to protect the public from that threat?'
