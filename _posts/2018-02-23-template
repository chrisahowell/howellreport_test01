My aunt passed away last year after suffering a stroke.  She was my mother\'s youngest sister.  I couldn't go to the funeral but I did write my uncle a letter giving my condolences. Anyway, my sister got some old photographs of me and my family from my aunt and uncle. Many of them are from the 1960's and early 1970's. 

It has been a real hoot to look through all these pictures.  I'm going to attempt to display one in this post to see how it comes out. This is is a photo of me when I was about 6 months old.  It seems like this was a completely different world.
